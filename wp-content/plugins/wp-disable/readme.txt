== Description ==
<strong>Reduce HTTP requests</strong> - Disable Emojis, Disable Gravatars, Disable Embeds and Remove Querystrings. SpeedUp WooCommerce, Added support to disable pingbacks, disable trackbacks, close comments after 28 days, Added the ability to force pagingation after 20 posts,

 <strong>**NEW Features:**</strong>
 Better Stats on Dashboard

 Disable Author Pages

Disabling Emojis does not disable emoticons, it disables the support for Emojis added since WP 4.2 and removes 1 HTTP request.<br>

Disabling Embeds  - script that auto formats pasted content in the visual editor, eg videos, etc. Big issue with this script is it loads on every
single page. You can still use the default embed code from YouTube, Twitter etc to included content.

Remove Query Strings: If you look at the waterfall view of your page load, you will see your query strings end in something like ver=1.12.4.
These are called query strings and help determine the version of the script. The problem with query strings like these is that it isn't very efficient for caching purposes and sometimes prevents caching those assets altogether.  If you are using a CDN already, you can ignore this.

Disabling Gravatars is completely optional, advise, if you don't use them, disable as it gets rid of one more useless HTTP request.

General Performance improvements: Added support for : disable ping/trackbacks, close comments after 28 days, force pagingation after 20 posts, Disable WooCommerce scripts and CSS on non WooCommerce Pages.

<a href="https://github.com/hosting-io/wp-disable">Public repo on GitHub</a> if you would like to contribute or have any ideas to add.

= Do I still need caching ? =

Yes, We have just release a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-performance/">WordPress Caching plugin</a> which is really easy to setup and includes a built in CD-rewrite rule system.<br>

= What about Minification, do I still need it? =

Yes, you absolutely do, and none come close to the awesome <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/"> Autoptimize</a> by Frank Goossens.

= Do I still need a CDN ? =

Yes, WarpCache is our recommended choice for the ultimate in flexibility and performance. <br>
We will soon be adding a free CDN for css/js for all users that is integrated with just an "on/off" switch in the plugin and no setup.

= What about my Image Compression =

You can try our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-image-compression/">Free Image Compression plugin</a> which has really good compression ratios with little to no loss of image quality.
